    "# Normalization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is a basic preprocessing technique used in data analytics. It involves two main steps:\n",
    "1. **Centering**: Subtracting the mean from the data.\n",
    "2. **Scaling**: Dividing by the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of normalization is to transform the data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This process helps in making different datasets comparable and prepares the data for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Z = X - x̄/σ\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( X ) is the original data.\n",
    "- \\( x̄ ) is the mean of the data.\n",
    "- \\( σ ) is the standard deviation of the data.\n",
    "- \\( Z \\) is the normalized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a 5x5 NumPy array filled with random numbers.\n",
    "2. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the array.\n",
    "3. Normalize the array using the formula above.\n",
    "4. Save the normalized array to a file called `X_normalized.npy`.\n",
